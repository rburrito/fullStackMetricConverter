**FreeCodeCamp**- Information Security and Quality Assurance
------

A freeCodeCamp project that I completed that that converts gallons to liters, kilograms to pounds, kilometers to miles, and vice versa. Includes functional and unit tests using Mocha framework and Chai assertion library. 

1) SET NODE_ENV to `test` without quotes
2) Most logic will need done in `controllers/convertHandler.js` but do complete `routes/api.js`
3) You will add any security features to `server.js`
4) You will create all of the functional/unit tests in `tests/2_functional-tests.js` and `tests/1_unit-tests.js`
